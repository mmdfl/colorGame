# Color Game

This application is a color guessing game where the user is presented with a target RGB color value and must select the corresponding colored card from a set of options. The game allows for two difficulty levels, "easy" (3 cards) and "hard" (6 cards), and provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or incorrect, prompting the user to play again or try another guess.
